## 1. What Aegis Protocol Is

Aegis Protocol is currently a **pilot-first, vault-only beta** on the Polkadot
Hub (Paseo testnet). Users can deposit and withdraw supported ERC-20 assets in
the vault. A risk-oracle workflow and route-submission path exist for
experimental evaluation, but they are **not** part of the default public beta
launch surface.

**Core value propositions:**

| Value | What it means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Vault-only beta** | The default launch surface is wallet connect plus supported deposit/withdraw flows on Paseo. |
| **Risk assessment beta** | The assistant can score routing ideas and return a prototype risk result without claiming live production execution. |
| **Non-custodial** | Users hold their own keys. The vault holds tokens only while they are deposited. Withdrawals are instant. |
| **XCM evaluation path** | The contract and UI keep an experimental XCM-related workflow for pilot environments, but launch-safe tooling keeps routing paused until a real target-chain path is proven. |
| **Intent-based UX** | Users can describe what they want in plain English and receive a prototype risk assessment for planning or pilot review. |

## 2. How the System Works End-to-End

```
User connects wallet
        │
        ├── Vault flow (default beta)
        │      ▼
        │   ERC-20 approve(vault, amount)
        │      ▼
        │   AegisVault.deposit(token, amount)
        │      • Vault pulls tokens from user wallet
        │      • Emits Deposit event
        │      ▼
        │   User can later call AegisVault.withdraw(token, amount)
        │      • Emits Withdrawal event
        │
        └── Assistant flow (assessment by default)
               ▼
            POST /api/risk-oracle  { intent: "earn yield safely" }
               ▼
            Risk Oracle scores intent (0–100)
              • OpenAI / Gemini if API key is set
              • Keyword fallback otherwise
               ▼
            Returns { parachainId: 1000, riskScore: 42, safeToRoute: true }
               ▼
            If experimental routing is explicitly enabled:
              • user can review a testnet route submission
              • /api/execute-route signs and submits routeYieldViaXCM(...)
              • route-related events may be emitted for evaluation, but this is
                still not proof of a live cross-chain message
```

## 3. Getting Real Transactions Running

This is the step-by-step checklist to go from zero to live transactions on Paseo.

### Step 1 — Get a funded Paseo wallet

1. Install MetaMask (or any EVM wallet).
2. Add Paseo Testnet manually:
   - Network name: `Paseo Testnet`
   - RPC URL: `https://eth-rpc-testnet.polkadot.io`
   - Chain ID: `420420417`
   - Currency symbol: `PAS`
3. Get testnet PAS from the faucet: https://faucet.polkadot.io/
   - Select "Paseo" and paste your EVM address.
   - You need at least 1 PAS for gas.

### Step 2 — Deploy the contracts

The contract currently on-chain (`0x2BEf...`) is an **outdated version** (2982 bytes
vs 8782 bytes in the current source). You must redeploy.

```bash
cd contracts
cp .env.example .env.paseo-local
cp .env.paseo-local .env.local
# Edit .env.paseo-local (or the active .env.local copy) and set PRIVATE_KEY
# before running setup. Keep separate env files for protected Moonbase/Moonbeam work.
npm run setup
# This runs scripts/setup-paseo.js which:
#   - Deploys the current demo vault flow for Paseo only
#   - Deploys mock tokens and registers them
#   - Prints the .env.local block to copy
```

For protected Moonbase / Moonbeam launch work, do **not** treat `npm run setup`
as a canonical bootstrap path. Use the checked-in launch profiles under
`config/launch/` plus `launch:deploy` / `launch:prepare` / `launch:verify` described
in the deployment reference below.

The script prints something like:

```
=== Paste this into frontend/.env.local ===

NEXT_PUBLIC_PASEO_RPC_URL=https://eth-rpc-testnet.polkadot.io
NEXT_PUBLIC_AEGIS_VAULT_ADDRESS=0x<new-vault>
NEXT_PUBLIC_WPAS_ADDRESS=0x<new-wpas>
NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_USDC_ADDRESS=0x<new-usdc>
NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x<new-usdc>
DEST_PARACHAIN_ID=1000
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_ROUTING=false
AI_ORACLE_RELAY_ENABLED=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_E2E_MOCK_WALLET=false
AI_ORACLE_PRIVATE_KEY=0x<your-private-key-here>
# Optional rotation metadata for operator checks:
# AI_ORACLE_KEY_VERSION=oracle-paseo-local-001
# AI_ORACLE_KEY_ROTATED_AT=2026-04-06T00:00:00Z
# AI_ORACLE_RELAY_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
# AI_ORACLE_RELAY_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://...
# AI_ORACLE_ALERT_WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN=<optional-bearer-token>
# AI_ORACLE_ALERT_SOURCE=aegis-paseo-relay
# AI_ORACLE_ALERT_TIMEOUT_MS=3000
# AI_ORACLE_RELAY_ALERT_ENVIRONMENT=railway-staging
# AEGIS_LAUNCH_KPI_DASHBOARD_AUTH_TOKEN=<strong-random-token>
```

### Step 3 — Configure the frontend

```bash
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
# Paste the block printed by setup-paseo.js
# For local demo-only work, AI_ORACLE_PRIVATE_KEY may match the deployment key.
# For Railway or protected environments, use a dedicated oracle-only key.
```

`AI_ORACLE_PRIVATE_KEY` is a **server-side secret** — it is never sent to the
browser. It is the private key of the wallet that was set as `aiOracleAddress`
during deployment. `setup-paseo.js` still defaults to deployer-equals-oracle for
local/demo work, but Railway or other protected environments should rotate to a
dedicated oracle-only signer, set `AI_ORACLE_KEY_VERSION` plus
`AI_ORACLE_KEY_ROTATED_AT`, and validate with `npm run relay:check-secrets`.
`AI_ORACLE_RELAY_ENABLED` stays `false` for the default public beta posture;
only enable it for explicit operator-controlled Paseo relay workflows.
`AEGIS_LAUNCH_KPI_DASHBOARD_AUTH_TOKEN` is a separate internal-only bearer token
for `GET /api/launch-kpi`; it should never be exposed in the browser or public
docs.
If you enable product instrumentation, treat those funnel counts as same-origin
client-reported directional signals, not CRM or anti-fraud evidence.

For protected Moonbase staging, switch the frontend/runtime to:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_AEGIS_ENV=moonbase-staging
NEXT_PUBLIC_MOONBASE_RPC_URL=https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network
NEXT_PUBLIC_MOONBASE_STAGING_VAULT_ADDRESS=0x<moonbase-vault>
NEXT_PUBLIC_MOONBASE_STAGING_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x<staging-stable>
NEXT_PUBLIC_MOONBASE_STAGING_TOKEN_SYMBOL=mUSDC
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_ROUTING=false
AI_ORACLE_RELAY_ENABLED=false
```

Use `docs/project-management/AEGIS_701_STAGING_ENVIRONMENT.md` as the manual
operator runbook for that protected staging mode.

### Step 3b — Configure protected launch envs

```bash
cp contracts/.env.example contracts/.env.moonbase-staging.local
cp contracts/.env.moonbase-staging.local contracts/.env.local
# Fill in RPC_URL, PRIVATE_KEY, owner/deployer addresses, and any profile token envs
# in the per-environment file, then copy the active one into contracts/.env.local
# before each launch command.
```

For a protected launch deployment, run:

```bash
cd contracts
npm run compile
npm run launch:deploy -- --profile moonbase-staging
```

This deploys `AegisVaultLaunch`, verifies the paused defaults on-chain, and
writes deployment metadata to `contracts/deployments/<profile>.json`. After that,
set `AEGIS_VAULT_ADDRESS` in `contracts/.env.local` to the deployed address and
continue with:

```bash
npm run launch:check-key-posture -- --profile moonbase-staging
npm run launch:prepare -- --profile moonbase-staging --mode plan
# Execute the emitted owner/multisig actions here.
npm run launch:verify -- --profile moonbase-staging --frontend-env ../frontend/.env.local
npm run launch:prove -- --profile moonbase-staging
```

Keep the same profile through deploy, prepare, verify, and prove. Keep separate
env files per protected environment and copy the active one to
`contracts/.env.local` before running launch commands. Only move to
`moonbeam-pilot` after the Moonbase staging packet and proof outputs are retained.
When `--frontend-env ../frontend/.env.local` is supplied, `launch:verify` treats
that file as the source of truth for `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` checks and fails if the
experimental-routing flag is missing there.

### Step 4 — Mint test tokens to your wallet

```bash
cd contracts
PRIVATE_KEY=0x<deployer-key> RECIPIENT=0x<your-wallet> npm run mint
# Mints 1,000 wPAS and 1,000 test-USDC to your wallet
```

### Step 5 — Start the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Open the preview URL shown in your terminal
```

### Step 6 — Make your first deposit

1. Open the app and connect your wallet (MetaMask on Paseo Testnet).
2. Go to **Vault** → select test-USDC → enter an amount → click **Deposit**.
3. MetaMask will ask you to approve two transactions:
   - First: ERC-20 `approve` (allows the vault to pull your tokens)
   - Second: `deposit` (vault pulls the tokens)
4. After both confirm, your balance appears in the vault stats.

### Step 7 — Optional: enable experimental route submission

The default beta keeps route submission **off**. If you are running an
operator-assisted pilot or local evaluation environment, explicitly opt in:

```bash
# frontend/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_ROUTING=true
```

After restarting the frontend, the **XCM Route Panel** and assistant can expose
the experimental submission path again.

The submission flow will:
- Call `routeYieldViaXCM` on-chain as the AI oracle
- Succeed only if the vault/oracle config is correct
- Emit route-related events on Paseo
- Still remain a beta evaluation path rather than a launch-safe XCM proof

The route CTA is still intentionally strict. Even in an enabled pilot
environment, submission only unlocks when:

- the connected wallet is on the active Aegis runtime
- the wallet has a non-zero deposited route-asset balance in the beta vault
- no tracked request is still pending for that wallet/runtime
- the latest failed request has been reviewed and dismissed
- the scoped portfolio snapshot is healthy

### Step 8 — Use the chat interface

Go to **Chat** → type something like "Earn yield safely on Acala" → the AI oracle
scores it. In the default beta, this stops at assessment. In an explicitly
enabled pilot environment, a confirmable experimental submission step appears
only when the current wallet also satisfies the route-eligibility checks above.

---

## 4. The Smart Contract

**Prototype file:** `contracts/contracts/AegisVault.sol`
**Launch file:** `contracts/contracts/AegisVaultLaunch.sol`
**Prototype deployment:** set by `npm run setup` → written to `contracts/deployments/paseo.json`

`AegisVault.sol` remains the current Paseo beta prototype with route and
rebalancing surfaces. `AegisVaultLaunch.sol` is the reduced-surface Moonbeam
launch target with single-token vault-only scope and explicit deposit/withdraw
pause controls.

### Prototype key functions

| Function | Who can call | What it does |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `deposit(token, amount)` | Anyone | Pulls ERC-20 from user, records balance |
| `withdraw(token, amount)` | Anyone | Returns ERC-20 to user |
| `routeYieldViaXCM(...)` | AI oracle only | Validates risk score, calls XCM precompile |
| `rebalanceVault(...)` | AI oracle only | Rebalances allocation across parachains |
| `addSupportedToken(token)` | Owner only | Whitelist a token for deposit |
| `setAIOracleAddress(addr)` | Owner only | Change the oracle wallet |
| `setXCMPrecompileAddress(addr)` | Owner only | Point to the real XCM precompile when live |
| `toggleXcmRoute()` | Owner only | Pause/unpause XCM routing (circuit breaker) |
| `toggleRebalancing()` | Owner only | Pause/unpause rebalancing |
| `setRouteCap(token, cap)` | Owner only | Limit how much of a token can be routed |
| `setRouteCapByAssetType(token, assetType, cap)` | Owner only | Limit routed amount per asset type |
| `transferOwnership(addr)` | Owner only | Hand ownership to the intended multisig/admin |

### Launch-contract key functions

| Function | Who can call | What it does |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `deposit(token, amount)` | Anyone | Pulls the fixed launch token from the user |
| `withdraw(token, amount)` | Anyone | Returns the fixed launch token to the depositor |
| `setDepositsPaused(bool)` | Owner only | Independently pause/unpause deposits |
| `setWithdrawalsPaused(bool)` | Owner only | Independently pause/unpause withdrawals |
| `transferOwnership(addr)` | Owner only | Hand ownership to the intended multisig/admin |

### Safety mechanisms

- **Risk gate:** `aiRiskScore >= 75` reverts with `RiskScoreTooHigh`. This is
  enforced on-chain — the oracle cannot bypass it.
- **Reentrancy guard:** All state-changing user functions use OpenZeppelin's
  `ReentrancyGuard`.
- **SafeERC20:** All token transfers use `SafeERC20` to handle non-standard tokens.
- **Route caps:** Owner can set a maximum amount that can be routed per token.
- **Circuit breaker:** `toggleXcmRoute()` pauses all XCM routing instantly.
- **Access control:** `onlyOwner` and `onlyAIOracle` modifiers on all privileged functions.

### Reading vault state

```javascript
// Using ethers.js or viem — replace with your deployed address
const vault = new ethers.Contract(VAULT_ADDRESS, ABI, provider);

await vault.getUserDeposit(userAddress, tokenAddress);  // user's deposited balance
await vault.totalDeposits(tokenAddress);                // total vault TVL for a token
await vault.getVaultBalance(tokenAddress);              // vault's actual token balance
await vault.supportedTokens(tokenAddress);              // true/false
await vault.aiOracleAddress();                          // current oracle wallet
await vault.xcmPrecompileAddress();                     // current XCM precompile
await vault.xcmRoutingPaused();                         // circuit breaker state
```

### Events to watch

| Event | When emitted | Key fields |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| `Deposit` | User deposits | `user`, `token`, `amount`, `timestamp` |
| `Withdrawal` | User withdraws | `user`, `token`, `amount`, `timestamp` |
| `YieldRoutedViaXCM` | Route executed | `destParachainId`, `amount`, `riskScore`, `timestamp` |
| `XcmRouted` | Same route, audit record | `parachainNonce`, `txHash` |
| `AIOracleUpdated` | Oracle address changed | `newOracleAddress` |
| `TokenSupported` | Token whitelisted | `token` |

---

## 5. The AI Risk Oracle

The oracle is a two-part system:

### Part A — Intent scoring (`/api/risk-oracle`)

**File:** `frontend/app/api/risk-oracle/route.ts`

Accepts a plain-English intent string and returns a risk score.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/risk-oracle \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"intent": "earn yield safely on Acala"}'

# Response:
{
  "parachainId": 1000,
  "riskScore": 42,
  "safeToRoute": true,
  "scoringMethod": "keyword"   # or "openai" / "gemini"
}
```

**Scoring methods (in priority order):**

1. **OpenAI** — set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `frontend/.env.local`. Uses `gpt-4o-mini`.
2. **Gemini** — set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `frontend/.env.local`. Uses `gemini-1.5-flash`.
3. **Keyword fallback** — always available, no API key needed.

The keyword fallback scores:
- `leverage`, `unsafe`, `degen`, `100x`, `flash loan`, `rug`, `ponzi` → **85** (blocked)
- `high yield`, `aggressive`, `speculative` → **55** (allowed but flagged)
- `safe`, `stable`, `stablecoin`, `usdc` → **30** (safe)
- Everything else → **42** (default safe)

**To add a real LLM:** The scoring functions are isolated in `route.ts`. Add your
provider's API call inside `scoreWithOpenAI` or `scoreWithGemini`, or add a new
function following the same pattern.

### Part B — On-chain execution (`/api/execute-route`)

**File:** `frontend/app/api/execute-route/route.ts`

This is the server-side oracle relay. It:
1. Reads the user's deposited balance from the vault
2. Encodes XCM asset data
3. Signs and submits `routeYieldViaXCM` as the AI oracle wallet

**Required for server-side route submission**

- `AI_ORACLE_RELAY_ENABLED=true`
- `AI_ORACLE_PRIVATE_KEY=0x<64-hex-chars>`
- `AI_ORACLE_RELAY_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...` or `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...` for hosted/operator deployments
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_ROUTING=true` only if you want the UI to expose the experimental route flow
- Optional: `AI_ORACLE_RELAY_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://...` for best-effort operator alerts on material relay failures

`NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_ROUTING` affects the UI only. `POST /api/execute-route`
remains disabled unless `AI_ORACLE_RELAY_ENABLED=true`.

This key must match the `aiOracleAddress` stored in the vault. After running
`npm run setup`, the deployer address is the oracle — use the same private key.

Before signing, the relay:

1. verifies it is running against **Paseo**
2. verifies the configured signer matches the vault's `aiOracleAddress`
3. refuses hosted operation without Postgres-backed storage
4. returns structured failure metadata (`failureCategory`, `retryDisposition`, `operatorAction`, `operatorAlertStatus`) for operator handling

The experimental UI now also keeps a wallet-scoped recent-request view:

- chat and vault routing surfaces render a shared `Recent Route Requests` panel
- the panel shows `requested -> validated -> submitted -> source_confirmed / failed`
- source-chain proof links only appear when `txHash` exists
- browser persistence is scoped by runtime + wallet
- status polling now calls `GET /api/execute-route?requestId=<id>&userAddress=<wallet>`

**Error responses and what they mean:**

| HTTP | Error | Fix |
|------|-------|-----|
| 400 | Missing userAddress | Pass `userAddress` in the query string alongside `requestId` |
| 400 | No deposited balance | User must deposit first |
| 400 | Token not supported | Run `addSupportedToken` from owner wallet |
| 403 | Route blocked by risk gate | Score >= 75; use a safer intent |
| 403 | Oracle address mismatch | `AI_ORACLE_PRIVATE_KEY` doesn't match vault's `aiOracleAddress` |
| 503 | Experimental route relay disabled | Set `AI_ORACLE_RELAY_ENABLED=true` for an explicit operator-controlled Paseo deployment |
| 503 | Durable relay storage is not configured | Set `AI_ORACLE_RELAY_DATABASE_URL` or `DATABASE_URL`, or use `AI_ORACLE_RELAY_ALLOW_FILE_STORE=true` only for single-instance local work |
| 503 | Route relay is pinned to Paseo only | Point the relay back to Paseo or leave it disabled |
| 503 | Route cap exceeded | Raise the relevant route cap before retrying |
| 501 | AI_ORACLE_PRIVATE_KEY not set | Add it to `frontend/.env.local` or the hosted server env |
| 503 | XCM routing paused | Call `vault.toggleXcmRoute()` from owner wallet |

---

## 6. The Frontend

**Stack:** Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind 4, wagmi 3, viem 2

### Pages

| Route | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `/` | `app/page.tsx` | Landing page with hero, features, CTA |
| `/vault` | `app/vault/page.tsx` | Deposit, withdraw, inspect current supported-asset positions, recent wallet history, and a gated experimental route panel |
| `/chat` | `app/chat/page.tsx` | Intent chat interface |
| `/activity` | `app/activity/page.tsx` | Transaction history and route-event summaries |

### Key components

| Component | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Web3Provider` | Configures wagmi from the shared runtime registry for `paseo-beta` or `moonbase-staging` |
| `Navbar` | Wallet connect button, navigation |
| `DepositForm` | ERC-20 approve → vault deposit flow |
| `WithdrawalForm` | Vault withdraw flow |
| `VaultStats` | Reads the server-owned `/api/portfolio` snapshot for supported-asset positions |
| `ChatInterface` | Intent input → risk oracle → optional confirm/cancel flow when experimental routing is enabled |
| `XcmRoutePanel` | Manual experimental route trigger when enabled for a pilot environment |
| `WalletHistoryTable` | Recent wallet deposits and withdrawals from the bounded wallet-history API |
| `TransactionHistory` | Activity-page table of normalized on-chain events and vault-wide route visibility |
| `YieldStatistics` | Yield route summary cards |

### Wallet connection

The app uses `wagmi` with the `injected()` connector (MetaMask, Rabby, etc.).
For E2E tests, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_E2E_MOCK_WALLET=true` or pass `?e2eMockWallet=1`
in the URL to use a mock wallet.

### Contract addresses

All addresses are resolved from `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars in `frontend/lib/contracts.ts`.
Zero-address fallbacks keep the UI renderable without a deployment, but all
contract reads will return zero values.

### Adding a new page

1. Create `frontend/app/<route>/page.tsx` with `"use client"` if it uses hooks.
2. Add a link in `Navbar.tsx`.
3. No routing config needed — Next.js App Router uses the filesystem.

---

## 7. XCM Cross-Chain Routing

### What XCM is

XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging) is Polkadot's native protocol for sending
messages between parachains and the relay chain. It is not a bridge — it is
built into the protocol. An XCM message can transfer assets, execute calls,
or do both.

### How Aegis uses XCM

The vault calls `IPolkadotXCM(xcmPrecompileAddress).sendXcm(parachainId, assets, feeAssetItem, weightLimit)`.

The XCM precompile is a special contract address that translates EVM calls into
XCM messages. In the current repo/tooling truth, the Polkadot-style precompile
address is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000801`.

### Current status on Paseo

The XCM precompile path is **not yet proven as a launch-safe workflow** on
Paseo's EVM layer. The truthful operator posture is to keep routing paused in
protected launch environments and treat any route-related Paseo activity as beta
evaluation, not as proof of live cross-chain delivery.

This means:
- Deposits, withdrawals, and route events all work today
- The actual cross-chain transfer is pending the precompile going live
- When it does, call `vault.setXCMPrecompileAddress(realAddress)` from the owner wallet

### XCM asset encoding

**File:** `frontend/lib/xcm-encoder.ts`

The encoder produces the `bytes` argument for `sendXcm`. It supports:

| Asset type | Use case | Encoding |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| `NATIVE` (0) | DOT/PAS on relay chain | `parents=1, interior=Here` |
| `WRAPPER_MAPPED` (1) | Statemine/Statemint assets | `parents=1, interior=X2(Parachain, GeneralIndex)` |

The encoding is hand-rolled (not using `@polkadot/api` SCALE codec). It follows
the XCM MultiAsset spec but has not been validated against a live precompile.
When the Paseo precompile ships, test with a small amount first.

### Destination parachain

Currently fixed to `DEST_PARACHAIN_ID=1000` (Paseo Asset Hub). To route to
other parachains, change this env var and ensure the target parachain is
registered on Paseo.

## 8. Testing

### Contract tests

```bash
cd contracts
npm test                          # Default prototype regression suite
npm run test:launch               # Reduced-surface launch-contract suite
npm run test:all                  # Full prototype sweep, including gas profile
npm run coverage                  # Coverage report → coverage/index.html
npm run gas                       # Prototype gas profile
```

**Test files:**

| File | What it covers |
|------|---------------|
| `test/AegisVault.test.js` | Mixed prototype regression: vault-core behavior plus prototype-only routing coverage |
| `test/AegisVault.rebalance.test.js` | Prototype-only rebalancing coverage kept for regression reference |
| `test/AegisVault.gas.test.js` | Prototype gas profile: vault flows keep regression ceilings, route path is profiled separately |
| `test/AegisVaultLaunch.test.js` | Reduced-surface launch contract coverage for ABI removal, one-token scope, pause controls, liability safety, and reentrancy |

All prototype tests use `MockXCM.sol` as the XCM precompile so they never hit a
real network. Treat the prototype suites as prototype evidence and the launch
suite as launch-contract source evidence. Final launch approval still requires
`launch:verify` and `launch:prove` against a deployed `AegisVaultLaunch`.

### Frontend E2E tests

```bash
cd frontend
npx playwright install chromium   # First time only
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:e2e:ci   # CI-oriented config; expects a separate build and uses port 3110
```

The current suite verifies that cancelling a routing intent does not submit a
wallet transaction and that activity/history/routing surfaces render explicit
unavailable states instead of zero-like fallback data when their APIs fail.

### Adding a new contract test

```javascript
// In contracts/test/AegisVault.test.js
it("does something new", async function () {
  const { aegisVault, mockToken, aiOracle, user1 } = await deployFixture();
  // ... your test
});
```

Always use `deployFixture()` — it deploys a fresh vault with MockXCM wired in.

### Adding a new E2E test

```typescript
// In frontend/tests/e2e/your-test.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test("description", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("/vault?e2eMockWallet=1");
  // ... your assertions
});
```

## 9. Deployment Reference

### Contract deployment

```bash
cd contracts

# Paseo demo setup only

```

After prototype deployment, `contracts/deployments/paseo.json` contains the
Paseo addresses. Protected launch deploys write `contracts/deployments/<profile>.json`.

The protected launch configs live under `config/launch/`. They are the
checked-in source of truth for Moonbase staging and Moonbeam pilot bootstrap
inputs. The new launch scripts are intentionally limited to `AegisVaultLaunch`
safety checks: launch token match, deposit/withdraw pause state, token metadata,
token whitelist, owner/deployer separation, experimental-routing flag posture,
and small deposit/withdraw smoke proofs through the live vault interface.

### Frontend deployment (Vercel)

1. Push to GitHub.
2. Connect the repo to Vercel.
3. **Set Root Directory to `frontend`** in Vercel project settings (General → Root Directory).
4. Add all `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars from your `.env.local`.
5. Add `AI_ORACLE_PRIVATE_KEY` as a **server-side** env var (not `NEXT_PUBLIC_`).
6. Deploy.

`frontend/vercel.json` provides the only Vercel config that should live in the repo. Do **not** add a `vercel.json` at the repo root — it conflicts with the `rootDirectory: frontend` project setting. If Vercel builds start failing with `ENOENT .next/routes-manifest-deterministic.json`, see the troubleshooting section below for the verified two-part fix (`postbuild` script + `outputFileTracingRoot: repoRoot`).

### Operator relay deployment (Railway)

Use Railway when you need hosted server-side relay execution for the current
Paseo operator workflow. Protected Moonbase staging still keeps hosted relay
execution off until the route runtime is generalized beyond Paseo.

1. Create a Railway service rooted at `frontend/`.
2. Attach Railway Postgres.
3. Set `AI_ORACLE_RELAY_ENABLED=true`.
4. Set `AI_ORACLE_PRIVATE_KEY` as a dedicated server-side oracle secret.
5. Set `AI_ORACLE_KEY_VERSION` and `AI_ORACLE_KEY_ROTATED_AT`.
6. Set `AI_ORACLE_RELAY_DATABASE_URL` from Railway Postgres or rely on `DATABASE_URL`.
7. Do **not** put `PRIVATE_KEY`, `BOOTSTRAP_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY`, or `PROOF_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` in the frontend/Railway service env.
8. Run `npm run relay:check-secrets`.
9. Only set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_ROUTING=true` if this deployment should expose the route UI.

Railway-managed secrets plus Railway Postgres are acceptable for Paseo/lower
environments. Moonbeam paid-pilot routing still needs HSM/KMS-class custody.

### Operator key posture checks

Use these before protected operator work or after any key rotation:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run relay:check-secrets

cd ../contracts
npm run launch:check-key-posture -- --profile moonbase-staging
npm run launch:check-key-posture -- --profile moonbeam-pilot
```

`relay:check-secrets` validates the active frontend/service env for forbidden key
placement, relay metadata, storage posture, and on-chain signer/vault
alignment. `launch:check-key-posture` validates deployer/owner separation plus
metadata for launch-tooling keys against the checked-in launch profiles.

### Operator monitoring baseline

The repo now exposes:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/relay-health
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/relay-health?strict=1'
```

Use the default path for uptime/read-plane health. Use `?strict=1` when a
monitor should treat degraded states as failures. The endpoint reports:

- relay posture (`disabled`, `ok`, `degraded`, `failed`)
- relay storage backend
- Paseo signer/vault preflight when the relay is enabled
- activity and portfolio read-path health
- recent relay incident counts for submitted, failed, and alert-delivery states

The canonical manual response guide for tx failure, rollback, paused routing,
and key compromise is now
`docs/project-management/AEGIS_705_RELEASE_SAFETY_RUNBOOKS.md`.
The recurring contracts / infra / dependency / incident maintenance cadence is
now `docs/project-management/AEGIS_903_MAINTENANCE_CHECKLIST.md`.

## 10. What Is Real vs. Simulated

Be honest about this when presenting the project.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Smart contract | ✅ Real | Deployed on Paseo, enforces all rules on-chain |
| ERC-20 deposit / withdraw | ✅ Real | Real token transfers, real wallet signatures |
| Risk gate enforcement | ✅ Real | On-chain revert if score >= 75 |
| AI risk scoring (LLM) | 🟡 Optional | Works if `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set; keyword fallback otherwise |
| Experimental route submission | 🟡 Gated | Disabled by default; UI requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_ROUTING=true`, server execution also requires `AI_ORACLE_RELAY_ENABLED=true` plus relay storage/signer config |
| On-chain route events | ✅ Real | Route-related events can be emitted when experimental routing is enabled |
| XCM cross-chain transfer | ⏳ Pending | Protected launch tooling keeps routing paused; the repo does not yet prove a live Moonbeam-safe XCM path |
| APY / yield data | ❌ Simulated | Hardcoded to 0; real APY requires an off-chain indexer + price feeds |
| Token prices | ❌ Simulated | Mock tokens have no market price |
| Destination vault | ❌ Simulated | `DESTINATION_VAULT_ADDRESS` is a placeholder |

## 11. Troubleshooting

### "No signers available" when running deploy script
Set `PRIVATE_KEY=0x<64-hex-chars>` in `contracts/.env.local`.

### MetaMask shows wrong network
Add Paseo Testnet manually: RPC `https://eth-rpc-testnet.polkadot.io`, chain ID `420420417`.

### Deposit transaction reverts with "TokenNotSupported"
The token is not whitelisted. Run `npm run setup` (which calls `addSupportedToken`)
or call it manually from the owner wallet.

### execute-route returns 403 "Oracle address mismatch"
The `AI_ORACLE_PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env.local` does not match the `aiOracleAddress`
stored in the vault. Either:
- Use the same private key that was used to deploy (the deployer is set as oracle by default)
- Or call `vault.setAIOracleAddress(newAddress)` from the owner wallet

### execute-route returns 503 "Experimental route relay is disabled"
The deployment is running with the server-side relay off. Set
`AI_ORACLE_RELAY_ENABLED=true` only for an explicit operator-controlled Paseo
deployment. `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_ROUTING=true` only affects the UI.

### execute-route returns 503 "Durable relay storage is not configured"
Set `AI_ORACLE_RELAY_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...` or `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...`
for hosted/operator deployments. Only use `AI_ORACLE_RELAY_ALLOW_FILE_STORE=true`
for single-instance local prototype work.

### execute-route returns 501 "AI_ORACLE_PRIVATE_KEY not set"
Add `AI_ORACLE_PRIVATE_KEY=0x<key>` to `frontend/.env.local` or the hosted server
env and restart the app.

### execute-route returns `failed` with retry guidance or alert status
Inspect `failureCategory`, `retryDisposition`, `operatorAction`, and
`operatorAlertStatus` in the response body. The current relay adds guidance and
best-effort webhook alerting, but it does **not** run automatic retries or a
background job queue.

### VaultStats shows 0 for everything
The vault address in `.env.local` is wrong or the contract is the old version.
Re-run `npm run setup` and update `.env.local` with the new address.

### Wallet history does not show relay requests
This is expected. The wallet-history API is intentionally limited to recent
on-chain deposits and withdrawals. Private relay follow-up stays on the direct
route response and request-status path instead of the generic wallet-history
surface.

### Build fails with "Too many re-renders"
This was a pre-existing bug in `TransactionHistory.tsx` — fixed in this session.
Run `npm run build` again.

### Vercel build fails — `ENOENT routes-manifest-deterministic.json`

Vercel's `@vercel/next` adapter (updated ~April 2026) now hardcodes the repo-root path when checking for `routes-manifest-deterministic.json`, even when `rootDirectory: frontend` is set. With `rootDirectory: frontend`, Next.js outputs to `frontend/.next/` but the adapter looks at `/vercel/path0/.next/`.

**The fix is two parts — both must be present:**

1. `frontend/package.json` must have a `postbuild` script that copies `.next/` to the repo root on Vercel:
   ```json
   "postbuild": "[ -n \"$VERCEL\" ] && (rm -rf ../.next && cp -r .next ../.next) || true"
   ```
2. `frontend/next.config.ts` must set `outputFileTracingRoot` to the repo root (not `frontend/`):
   ```ts
   const repoRoot = fileURLToPath(new URL("..", import.meta.url));
   // ...
   outputFileTracingRoot: repoRoot,
   ```

Without both changes: (1) `routes-manifest-deterministic.json` not found; (2) `node_modules/next/` resolved at wrong path by the Vercel adapter.

Do **not** use `distDir: "../.next"` — Turbopack (default in Next.js 16) rejects parent-directory distDir with a fatal error.
Do **not** clear `rootDirectory` in Vercel — framework auto-detection fails since the repo-root `package.json` doesn't list `next`.

### Vercel build fails — framework not detected

If Vercel can't find the Next.js framework:

1. Ensure `rootDirectory: frontend` is set in the Vercel project dashboard (General → Root Directory).
   This is required. Clearing it causes "No Next.js version detected" errors.
2. **Also** ensure `frontend/package-lock.json` pins the Linux native CSS packages (see next entry).

### Railway build fails with missing `lightningcss` or `@tailwindcss/oxide`
If Railway logs show `Cannot find native binding`, `lightningcss.linux-x64-gnu.node`,
or `@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu`, the Linux-native CSS toolchain packages
were not present in the frontend lockfile used by Railway.

Keep these entries in `frontend/package.json` under `optionalDependencies`:

- `lightningcss-linux-x64-gnu`
- `@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu`

Then regenerate `frontend/package-lock.json`, push, and redeploy. This is an npm
optional-dependency lockfile issue that can appear when dependency changes are
made on macOS and later deployed to Railway's Linux environment.

### Contract tests fail
Run `cd contracts && npm install` first. `npm test` is the passing prototype
regression suite, and `npm run gas` profiles the prototype route path
separately. Neither command is launch-contract approval evidence for the future
reduced-surface Moonbeam deployment.

### XCM routing reverts on-chain
Do not treat this as something to "fix" by pointing the vault at `address(0)`.
The current launch-safe posture is to keep routing paused, verify the bootstrap
state, and avoid using route execution as proof until the target-chain path is
adapted and verified. For protected environments, re-run:

```bash
cd contracts
npm run launch:verify -- --profile moonbeam-pilot --frontend-env ../frontend/.env.local
```

## 12. Roadmap and Next Steps

### Immediate (unblocked today)

- [ ] Run `npm run setup` to redeploy the current contract version
- [ ] Decide whether this deployment is public beta (`AI_ORACLE_RELAY_ENABLED=false`) or an operator-controlled relay workflow (`AI_ORACLE_RELAY_ENABLED=true`)
- [ ] Set `AI_ORACLE_PRIVATE_KEY` in `frontend/.env.local`
- [ ] Make your first real deposit in the vault-only beta
- [ ] Decide whether you actually need experimental routing enabled for a pilot environment
- [ ] Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` for real AI scoring

### Short term

- [ ] **Verify XCM precompile address** — monitor Polkadot Hub release notes for
  when the XCM precompile goes live on Paseo. When it does, call
  `vault.setXCMPrecompileAddress(realAddress)`.
- [ ] **Validate XCM encoding** — test `xcm-encoder.ts` output against the live
  precompile with a small amount. The encoding follows the spec but has not been
  validated against a real precompile call.
- [ ] **Deploy the public beta to Vercel** — push to GitHub, connect to Vercel, set env vars.
- [ ] **Deploy relay-enabled lower environments to Railway** — attach Postgres, set `AI_ORACLE_RELAY_ENABLED`, and keep the signer key server-side only.
- [ ] **Wire operator alert routing if needed** — set `AI_ORACLE_RELAY_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` plus optional auth/source envs for best-effort relay failure alerts.
- [ ] **Add more E2E tests** — deposit flow, withdrawal flow, risk gate rejection.

### Medium term

- [ ] **Real APY data** — integrate an on-chain indexer (SubQuery, Subsquid) or
  a price feed (Chainlink, DIA) to show real yield percentages.
- [ ] **Multiple destination parachains** — allow the oracle to route to Acala,
  Astar, Moonbeam, etc. based on the intent. Currently fixed to parachain 1000.
- [ ] **Separate oracle wallet** — the deployer and oracle are the same address.
  Generate a dedicated oracle wallet, fund it with PAS for gas, and call
  `vault.setAIOracleAddress(oracleAddress)` from the owner wallet.
- [ ] **Route cap configuration UI** — let the owner set per-token route caps
  from the frontend instead of requiring a direct contract call.

### Long term

- [ ] **Mainnet deployment** — when Polkadot Hub launches on mainnet with the
  XCM precompile, redeploy with real tokens (DOT, USDC).
- [ ] **Governance** — replace `onlyOwner` with a multisig or DAO for parameter
  changes.
- [ ] **Yield strategy registry** — let parachain teams register their yield
  strategies so the oracle can route to the best one dynamically.
